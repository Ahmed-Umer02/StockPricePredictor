# Stock Price Predictor

The Repo is dedicated to the creation of a stock price prediction model/AI.

Initially this will be using the end of day and last week-months worth of data to predict the next days high and low.

In the future this will utilize live stock data to predict the highs and lows for each day for a specific stock :
    - This will have a UI component that lets you choose the stock and outputs the high and low
    - Along with the time that the high and low will occur and when the biggest positive and negative movements will occur
    - Additionaly to the initial price for that movement and the end price of that movement.
